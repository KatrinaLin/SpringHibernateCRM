# SpringHibernateCRM

This is a project from a course on Udemy.com

The course's name is Spring & Hibernate for Beginners by Chad Dardy.

This project is to create a simple Customer Relationship Management system implemented with the Spring MVC and Hibernate framework. The CRM system can be used to create, read, update and delete customer information that will be stored in MySQL database.

The project contains four main packages: Entity, Controller, Service, DAO. There is one more package, testdb that can be used to test the basic database connection.

I am planning to continue the work on the CRM to extend its functionalities.
